# LeHaMoC: Leptonic-Hadronic Modeling Code for High-Energy Astrophysical Sources

LeHaMoC is a leptohadronic modeling code designed for simulating high-energy astrophysical sources. It simulates the behavior of relativistic pairs, protons interacting with magnetic fields and photons in a spherical region. The physical processes that are included are:


1. Synchrotron emission and self-absorption
2. Inverse Compton scattering
3. Photon-photon pair production
4. Adiabatic losses 
5. Proton-photon pion production 
6. Proton-photon (Bethe-Heitler) pair production
7. Proton-proton collisions 

The user can also model expanding spherical sources with a variable magnetic field strength. The user can also define 3 types of external radiation fields:

-Grey body or black body

-Power-law

-Tabulated

## Files Included

1. **LeHaMoC.py**: This file contains the main code for the LeMoC simulation. It takes user-defined parameters from `Parameters*.txt` to set up the simulation.

2. **Parameters.txt**: Users should edit this file to specify the parameters for their simulation. This includes setting up the initial conditions, time interval, and other relevant parameters. There are currently two input files ready for use that correspond to Tests 1 and 3 described in Stathopoulos et al.

3. **LeHaMoC_f.py**: This file includes all the necessary formulas for calculating emissivities and energy loss rates for various processes such as Synchrotron, Inverse Compton (IC), gamma-gamma absorption, pair creation, and Synchrotron self-absorption.

##zkd notes
These notes are meant for to be erased once one decides how/if to use any changes.

#### pyproject.toml
- added this file to help with dependencies and to make it easier to install the code in a virtual environment
- make sure to go through it a check if anything needs to be changed. 
- This should make it easier to upload to pypi. If you do upload it, you may want to consider prebuilding wheels since it takes a while to install
- to install in the directory, run `pip install -e .` in the directory where the pyproject.toml file is located

#### tables
- just a place to put tables for organization

#### figs
- just a place to put figures for organization

#### constants.pu
- a file for constants so that they don't have to be added to each file

#### simultion_params.py
- this file has the SimulationParams dataclass. This contains on the paramaters for LeHaMoC. This is meant to be used to make it easier to pass parameters to the LeHaMoC. It also includes severl helper functions for loading and saving to param files
